[15 p] Lab 10: Angular, Spring, JPA

- continue to work individually on the previous project (same repo)
- Spring Boot is, from now on, allowed (the project structure should be the same as before i.e. core, web)
- CRUD operations (the link entity/entities e.g. Rental, StudentDiscipline is/are for now not required; relations - for now, not required)
- Filter, sort operations (client-side and server-side; on server-side, with Spring Data JPA)
- Use both reactive and template-driven forms and validate user input (self study)
- Use ES6 features (or above) and follow redux principles (see readme)
- There should be four root entities and the requirements may be split over them, e.g., CRUD operations on entity1, client-side filters on entity2, server-side filters on entity3 etc


[15 p] Lab 11: Angular, Spring, JPA - mapping relationships

- continue to work individually on the previous project (same repo)
- Implement relationships between entities; the fetch type will be eager 
- There should be at least four root entities and one repository per root aggregate; there should be no repository for the link entities (e.g. StudentDiscipline); 
- there should be at least one relationship from each of the following: many-to-many, one-to-many, one-to-one 
  (many-to-many may be implemented with two one-to-many associations; one-to-one may be implemented with embeddable)
- Operations on the link entity (e.g. enroll students to disciplines, assign/view/etc grades); 
- reports/statistics
